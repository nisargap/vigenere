# Vigenere Ciphere By: Nisarga Patel

## If you have any questions please email me at np8@umbc.edu. Thank you!

Description: This is my Golang implementation of the Vigenere cipher. This program has two modes in the first mode you can pass in command line arguments for key and plaintext and are able to generate the ciphertext. In the second mode if you pass in no argumenets the program asks you for a key and a filename. The file's text contents is encrypted in this mode and returned as ciphertext and is decrypted right after to verify that the encryption is correct.

## Example Usage 1

./vigenere somekey this\ is\ the\ plaintext

.vigenere anotherkey longword

## Example Usage 2

./vigenere

... key is prompted for and filename is prompted for with ciphertext showing right after
